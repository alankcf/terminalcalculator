# C Programming Project
A project I wrote after taking [APSC 160](https://courses.students.ubc.ca/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-course&dept=APSC&course=160), first year computer science course! I thought this would be a great way to incorporate what I have learnt from this course into one program. Includes uses of branching, functions, user input, arrays, and strings.

## The Program
This is a program that prompts a user of a mathemtical expression between two numbers, all in one line. Coded with the C programming language.

## Using My Code
Please refer to the [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) if you would like to use any of my code.
