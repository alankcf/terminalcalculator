# C Programming Project
A project I wrote after a first year computer science course! I thought this would be a great way to apply what I have learnt from this course into one program. Includes uses of arrays, branching, functions, loops, strings, and user input.

## About
This is a program that prompts, and then evaluates, a user input of a mathematical expression (division, exponent, multiplication, addition, subtraction) between two numbers, all in one line. Coded with the C programming language.

## Using My Code
